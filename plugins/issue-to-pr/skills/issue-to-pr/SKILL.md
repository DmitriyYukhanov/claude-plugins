description: >-
  Drive a GitHub issue — bare or tracked on a Project board — from triage to a
  merge-ready PR through a gated pipeline (design hardening, tests green,
  code-review clean), scaling the machinery to the task's tier and asking at most one
  batched question. Auto-links the issue to close on merge, advances the board card,
  then merges and cleans up once you approve the PR in-session. Triggers: "take task
  N", "work on issue #N", "do the next task", and — for the merge gate on a later
  turn — "merge it", "approve the PR", "ship it", "lgtm merge".

# issue-to-pr — issue → merge-ready PR pipeline

One repeatable, gated flow: the **gates** (design hardening, tests green, review clean,
approval-gated merge) block progress; the depth between them scales to the tier. Mechanics
live in tested scripts (`S/` = `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/`, `R/` = `references/`); you
own judgment. One todo per step.

## Hard rules (never violate)

- **New task = new branch in its own worktree** (`S/worktree.sh ensure`), cut from the
  resolved base. All work happens there; never two tasks in one tree.
- **Merge is gated on explicit in-session approval**, runs ONLY in the main session
  (plugin agents ignore the hook), via `S/approve.sh` + `S/worktree.sh merge` — never a
  bare `gh pr merge`, never on the turn the PR opens.
- **Ask contract:** contact the user at exactly three moments — (1) ONE batched
  `AskUserQuestion` at Step 4.5 (only if the ledger has open items), (2) the merge gate,
  (3) a hard stop. Decide everything else yourself and log it (see below).
- Stage with **explicit paths** (`git add path1 path2`); never `git add -A`/`.` (a hook
  denies it). Conventional Commits. TDD (failing test first) for any logic.
- **Humanizer** runs on 100% of human-facing text (report, PR body, UI strings > 1–2 words)
  regardless of tier — not code/logs/commit subjects. Don't claim "green/passing" without the
  command output. Don't ask what a script or the code can answer.

## Config, tier, ask contract, state

- **Config** (`.claude/issue-to-pr.local.md`, optional): `preflight.sh` parses it +
  resolves gate commands and base (schema `R/configuration.md`); resolve in the main
  checkout up front (gitignored, absent in the worktree). **Companions** (if installed,
  else inline): `superpowers:*`, `/deep-research`, `/cross-review`, `humanizer`,
  `/code-review` (`R/companions.md`).
- **Tier** (`R/tier-matrix.md`): Step 2 pipes `triage-evidence.sh` into `tier-select.sh`
  → `TIER`, routing research, design, review level/passes, security overlay, and report
  length. `--tier` overrides.
- **Autonomy** (`R/autonomy.md`, read once at Step 0): the ask contract (three contact
  moments; log every judgment call to `state.json.ledger[]` before the next tool call;
  auto-decisions rendered in the report + PR body), the `state.json` schema + append-only
  `step.log` ground truth, and the resume path (log wins over stale state).

## Steps

**0. Resolve + preflight.** Turn the request into an issue (free text → draft one if scope is
clear; a draft board card → convert it to an issue first; `next` → the board's top card).
`S/preflight.sh <N> [--claim]` → auth/scopes, repo, `BASE`/`START_POINT`, gate
cmds, issue state, `WORKTREE_STATE`, board membership. **`WARN_CLAIMED_BY` → hard stop and
ask before any further work** (never run an opus design on someone else's issue).
`gh-auth-failed` (2) / config parse (4) → stop. Write the initial state.json.

**1. Worktree.** `S/worktree.sh ensure <N> --branch feat|fix/issue-<N>-<slug> --start-point
<START_POINT>`; `cd WT_PATH`, install deps via `INSTALL_HINT` through `run-gates.sh`.
Exit-code dispatch (bad-checkout, stale dir, invalid start-point, exit-3 in-place fallback):
`R/contracts.md`. Board-mode: `S/board-sync.sh <owner/repo> <N> in_progress` in the
background (add `--option "$STATUS_MAP_IN_PROGRESS"` if preflight reported one).

**2. Triage.** `S/triage-evidence.sh <N> | S/tier-select.sh [--tier …]` → `TIER`; record it.

**3. Research** (tier routes it, complex+ with unknowns): the forked `research` sub-skill (or
`/deep-research`) returns a ≤150-line cited summary; raw exploration stays out of context.

**4. Design** (tier routes it). Complex+: `Workflow({scriptPath:
"S/../workflows/design-panel.js", args:{issue,title,contextFiles,constraints,openQuestions}})`
→ `design_md` (→ `tmp/task-<N>/design.md`) + rejected alternatives + open questions. Accept
only if `design_md` non-empty and `rejected_alternatives.length >= 1`, else inline
self-review; `/cross-review` critiques the result. Preference-bound questions → ledger.
Standard: a mini-design in the PR body.

**4.5. Checkpoint (unconditional slot).** If the ledger has open `asked` items, ask them in
ONE batched `AskUserQuestion`. Empty ledger → no-op. The only mid-run question.

**5. Plan + implement.** Turn the design into a plan (`superpowers:writing-plans` for
complex+); TDD: failing test → implement → passing. UI/layout work is verified with
`<visual_cmd>` or a browser test, never eyeballing.

**6. Gates.** `S/run-gates.sh --log-dir tmp/task-<N>/logs --gate typecheck='<typecheck_cmd>'
--gate test='<test_cmd>'` (+ `--gate visual=…` for UI). An empty gate command degrades
(exit 4), never a false green. Red ⇒ STOP and fix. Never proceed red.

**7. Review loop.** `/code-review <level> --fix` at the tier's level, ≤ tier's max passes.
**Security overlay:** `git diff --name-only "$BASE"...HEAD | S/sensitive-paths.sh`; `SENSITIVE=true`
→ +1 `/security-review`. Track `confirmed_bugs_this_pass`/`gate_fail_streak` in metrics; **escalate a level** on 2+ confirmed bugs/pass or a gate failing twice; re-run gates after each fix.

**8. Re-gates + pin config.** Re-run `run-gates.sh` (all green). If auto-detected cmds passed
and config lacks them, `S/pin-config.sh --config <ORIGINAL_ROOT>/.claude/issue-to-pr.local.md
--test '…' …` (the main checkout — NOT the worktree, which Step 12 deletes); note in the report.

**9. Commit + PR.** `git add <explicit paths>`, conventional subjects; `git push -u origin
<branch>`; `gh pr create` against `BASE`, `Closes #<N>`, humanized body (autonomous-decisions
section + rejected alternatives). Board-mode: `S/board-sync.sh <owner/repo> <N> in_review`.
**Stop** — merging is Step 11.

**10. Report.** Length per tier (3 lines → full). What was built and why, test status with the
green proof, the autonomous decisions, the PR link, and the `metrics` telemetry (gate runs,
review passes/level, which machinery fired). Hand back: ask when to merge, and **stop**.

## Step 11 — Merge on approval (GATE)

Return to your working tree first: `cd` into `../<repo>-worktrees/issue-<N>` (worktree
mode); in the in-place fallback stay in the main checkout on `<branch>`. Then read the reply
against *this* PR. **Merge only on an unambiguous go-ahead to merge THIS PR — the burden is
on a clear approval. If the reply is anything else, do not merge.**
- **Go-ahead** ("merge it", "lgtm, ship it", "approved", "go ahead and merge") → `S/approve.sh
  <branch> --quote "<verbatim reply>"`, then `S/worktree.sh merge <N> --branch <branch>`. That
  script is the only sanctioned merge path; the hook + the script both validate the single-use
  marker before `gh pr merge` runs. If `merge` exits 2 (`STOP_REASON=`), **skip cleanup**.
- **Change requests** → implement in the worktree, **re-run the tier gates** (Steps 6–7 on the
  new diff) until clean, push, re-report, wait again. Never merge unverified changes.
- **Anything else** → do **not** merge. A vague ack ("ok", "looks fine") or a question → ask for
  explicit confirmation. If they'll self-merge/abandon, offer `S/worktree.sh teardown <N>` (keeps
  the PR + remote branch; never `cleanup`, which deletes them). Approval is never inferred.

## Step 12 — Cleanup (after a successful merge)

Only after Step 11 merges. Confirm honestly: GitHub closes the issue / advances the card
**only on a merge into the default branch** — on a non-default base the issue stays open, so
say so. **`cd` your shell into the main checkout first** (a shell whose cwd is the worktree
locks it on Windows). Salvage any lasting design doc, then `S/worktree.sh cleanup <N> --branch
<branch> --salvage-to <dir>` (removes the worktree, deletes the merged local + remote branch +
marker). Report from its keys — `DELETED_LOCAL=false` or a `LEFTOVER_DIR` means a locked dir
remains; say so, remove it by hand once the lock clears. In-place fallback (no worktree):
switch off `<branch>`, delete it local+remote, sweep the scratchpad temp (keep committed
`docs/`, PR content, anything you were asked to keep). Details: `R/contracts.md` →
"worktree.sh". Finish with one line: what merged, what was removed, what was kept.

## Friction log (replaces the old improve-this-skill step)

When a step genuinely fought back, append one dated one-line note to
`.claude/issue-to-pr/friction.log`; `/issue-to-pr:tune` batches it into fixes later (mention it in the report only above 10 lines).
